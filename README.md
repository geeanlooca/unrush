# unrush
A tool to scan a media library and set the default audio track to a preferred language


## Notes

- There can be cases in which the language of each track is undefined (Faster, Pussycat...)
- There can be cases in which no track is set as default
- TODO: Need to find a way to determine which language to set as default for cases above and for cases in which we don't know the original language (Perfect Days)
- TODO: `langcodes` distance values: https://github.com/rspeer/langcodes?tab=readme-ov-file#distance-values
